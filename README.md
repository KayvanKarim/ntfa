# NTFA: Network Flow Aggregator 

 NTFA  is a customisable network flow aggregator that aggregates flow data based on different time windows defined by the user.

To run the NTFA:

`python ntfa.py <flow-data-file.csv>`

After entering the file name, the user should set the project name. If the project has more than one CSV with the same column name, the user can use the same config file.
